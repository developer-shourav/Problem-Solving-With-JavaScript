## Practice Problem 50 

```
const people = [
    {name: 'Meena', age: 20},
    {name: 'Rina', age: 15},
    {name: 'Suchorita', age: 22}
];

```

1. `Challenging:` Follow above array of objects. So, you have 3 objects as
array element. Can you find out the total sum from here?

**20 + 15 + 22 = 57 . The output will be 57**

What are you thinking? Yeah! Do it with `for loop.` I know you can do it.
But! Wait !! Wait !!! Do the same task using `array.reduce()` method.
