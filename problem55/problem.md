```
let data = {
  Sophia: {
        id: 33,
        study: [
                {
                    primary: [
                    { school_name: "ABC primary school" },
                    { location: "Peters burg" },
                    ],
                },
                {
                    secondary: [
                    { school_name: "ABC secondary school" },

                    { location: "St Lorence" },
                    ],
                },
        ],
  },
};
