## Practice Problem 47 ( map(), filter(), find() )

1. You have **an odd array (array with odd numbers). [ 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 ].**
Now convert this array **into an even array (array with even numbers). [ 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 ].** 
Do this using `for loop` & `array.map()`
method. Hints: add one to any odd number and it will become an even
number.

2. You are given **an array say: [33, 50, 79, 78, 90, 101, 30 ]**. Now
return/get all the elements which are divisible by 10 using
`array.filter()` method.

3. Now do the **same task of question 2.** But do this using `array.find()`
method. Then **compare the output** of question 2 & question 3.
