## Problem 67:

### Create a function that takes a sorted array of numbers and a target value as input. The function should find two numbers in the array that add up to the target value. Return an array containing the indices of the two numbers.

**Example `Input: ([1, 3, 6, 8, 11, 15], 9)` Example `Output: [1, 2] (numbers at indices 1 and 2: 3 + 6 = 9)`**
